game itself:

based on civilizations evolving

research tab and main tab, maybe settings and about additionally
research will be scrollable tree
initial upgrade to unlock research for 0 "points"
maybe pixel art for upgrades but save that for after game works
on main tab button with text "blessing of life" that creates 1 human
each human can provide 1 research point, can work diff jobs
people need food, housing, third thing i haven't thought of
upgrades unlock new ways to obtain things
houses are built with resources
can be automated with builders

consider adding electricity/electricity generation
