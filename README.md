# Untitled Incremental

this is my first attempt at a real unique-ish game. it is written entirely in pygame (MISTAKE) and ported to the web with [pygbag](https://pypi.org/project/pygbag)
<br>the game runs much better locally because i didn't optimize the button drawing system very well, but the browser demo is playable
<br> this is by far the largest project i've ever made, and despite it being pretty boring to play and having a simple ui i'm still proud of it
<br> also made for [high seas](https://highseas.hackclub.com/)
